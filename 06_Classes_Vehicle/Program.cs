//! Classes 
/*
    -Custom objects in C#
    -Have properties and methods. 
        -Properties: Variables that exist in the entire class

    Key words: 
        -public: can be accessded by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that reference it. 
        -private: can only be accessed in the same class or struct 
        -protected: can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class. 
        -internal: type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly. 
        protected internal: can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly. 
        private protected: can be accessed only within its declared assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class. 

    Structs: 
        -used by small data-centric type with little or no behavior.
